# Retinal Disease Detection

In this project the problem of multi disease classification is addressed. Particularly, the focus of this project is on a subset of diseases presented on this Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/vietai-advance-course-retinal-disease-detection/overview.

We have images from Retinas that can have multiple diseases:
* Normal
* Diabetic Retinopathy
* Glaucoma

The objective of this project is to classify an image of a retina with the labels above

- A sample of the detections is shown below:
